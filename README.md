# Lupe's Burgers

**What is it:**
Homework #14:
In this activity, I created a burger logger. When you click on the page you will automatically see three burgers on the left side ready to be devoured. Once you click the devour button, the burgers will automatically move to the right. Create your own burgers by inputting them in the "make your own burger" box. Below is a video of the app in action.
